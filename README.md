# Maze Problem

We will be solving Maze Problem where we have to start from a point A in a maze and reach to point B avoiding obstacles. We have 3 different mazes in maze1.txt, maze2.txt and maze3.txt which we will solve as an example of this problem.

This problem will be solved using two approaches: 

### 1. Depth Fist Search Algorithm
>  Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

### 2. Breadth First Search Algorithm
> Breadth-first search is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
